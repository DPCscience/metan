# metan <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

The metan (**m**ulti-**e**nvironment **t**rials **an**alysis) package provides useful functions for analyzing multi-environment trial data using parametric and nonparametric methods, including, but not limited to:

* Within-environment analysis of variance;
* Estimation using AMMI considering different numbers of interaction principal component axes;
* AMMI-based stability indexes;
* GGE biplot analysis;
* Prediction in mixed-effect models;
* BLUP-based stability indexes;
* Variance components and genetic parameters in mixed-effect models;
* Cross-validation procedures for AMMI-family and BLUP models;
* Graphics tools for generating biplots;
* Parametric and nonparametric stability statistics

For more details see the [complete vignette](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/).

# Installation

To install the latest development version from Github, install the newest version of the devtools package; then run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/metan")

# To build the HTML vignette use
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/metan", build_vignettes = TRUE)

```


*Note*: If you are a Windows user, you should also first download and install the latest version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

For the latest release notes on this development version, see the [NEWS file](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/news/index.html).


# Getting started

Here, we will use the example dataset `data_ge` that contains data on two variables assessed in 10 genotypes growing in 14 environments. For more details see `?data_ge`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(metan)

```

The first step is to inspect the data with the function `inspect()`.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.align="center"}
inspect(data_ge, plot = TRUE)
```

No issues while inspecting the data. Let's continue with the analyzes!

## AMMI model
### Fitting the model
The AMMI model is fitted with the function `performs_ammi()`. For more details, see the [complete vignette](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/articles/vignettes_ammi.html).

```{r}
model <- performs_ammi(data_ge,
                       env = ENV,
                       gen = GEN,
                       rep = REP,
                       resp = GY,
                       verbose = FALSE)
```


### Predicting the response variable
The S3 method `predict()` is implemented for objects of class `performs_ammi` and may be used to estimate the response of each genotype in each environment considering different number of Interaction Principal Component Axis (IPCA). For example, we will use four IPCA (number of significant IPCAs) to estimate the variable GY using the `model` object. Note that `$GY` was used because using the `predict()` function to a model of class `waas` return a list, with one `tbl_df` for each variable.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE }
predict(model, naxis = 4)$GY

```


### Biplots

ggplot2-based graphics are easily obtained in metan package. For example, the well-known AMMI2 biplot may be obtained as follows. Please, note that since `waas()` function allows analyzing multiple variables at the same time, e.g., `resp = c(v1, v2, ...)`, the output `model` is a list, in this case with one element, GY.

```{r AMMI, fig.width=15, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
a <- plot_scores(model)
b <- plot_scores(model,
                 type = 2,
                 polygon = TRUE,
                 col.env = "gray70",
                 col.segm.env = "gray70",
                 axis.expand = 1.5)
c <- plot_scores(model, type = 4)
arrange_ggplot(a, b, c, labels = letters[1:3], nrow = 1)

```



## GGE model
The GGE model is fitted with the function `gge()`. For more details, see the [complete vignette](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/articles/vignettes_gge.html).


```{r GGE, fig.width=15, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model <- gge(data_ge, ENV, GEN, GY)
model2 <- gge(data_ge, ENV, GEN, GY, svp = "genotype")
model3 <- gge(data_ge, ENV, GEN, GY, svp = "symmetrical")
d <- plot(model)
e <- plot(model2, type = 8)
f <- plot(model2,
          type = 2,
          col.gen = "black",
          col.env = "gray70",
          axis.expand = 1.5)
arrange_ggplot(d, e, f, labels = letters[4:6], nrow = 1)

```



## BLUP model
Linear-mixed effect models to predict the response variable in METs are fitted using the function `waasb()`. Here we will obtain the predicted means for genotypes in the variables `GY` and `HM`. For more details, see the [complete vignette](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/articles/vignettes_blup.html).

```{r }
model2 <- waasb(data_ge, ENV, GEN, REP,
                resp = c(GY, HM),
                verbose = FALSE)

get_model_data(model2, what = "genpar")
get_model_data(model2, what = "blupg")

```


### Plotting the BLUPs for genotypes

To produce a plot with the predicted means, use the function `plot_blup()`.

```{r BLUP, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
g <- plot_blup(model2)
h <- plot_blup(model2,
               prob = 0.1,
               col.shape  =  c("gray20", "gray80")) + ggplot2::coord_flip()
arrange_ggplot(g, h, labels = letters[7:8])

```


### BLUPS for genotype-vs-environment interaction

The object `BLUPgge` contains the blups for the genotype-vs-environment interaction. In the following example, the values for `GY` are shown.
```{r }
model2$GY$BLUPgge
```

When more than one variable is fitted, the predicted means for genotype-vs-environment combination may be obtained for all variables in the model using `get_model_data()`.

```{r }
get_model_data(model2, what = "blupge")

```


# Computing parametric and non-parametric stability indexes

```{r}
stats <- ge_stats(data_ge, ENV, GEN, REP, GY)
get_model_data(stats, "stats")
get_model_data(stats, "ranks")
```
