# Resubmission of package `metan`
This is a **resubmission** for the new package `metan`. Now in version 1.2.1, I have incorporated the feedback kindly provided by Martina Schmirl on January 08, 2020.

> 
Please add references describing the methods in your package also to the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) <doi:...> authors (year) <arXiv:...> authors (year, ISBN:...) or only if none those are available:  <https:...> with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")


   * Done! I've included references describing the methods in description field of the DESCRIPTION file.
