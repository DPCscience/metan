\title{Mahalanobis distance from designed experiments}
\usage{
mahala_design(.data, gen, rep, resp, design = "RCBD",
  return = "distance")
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The dataset containing the columns related to Genotypes,
replication/block and response variables. Alternatively, it is possible to
use an object of class 'split_factors' to compute the distance for each
level of the grouping factor. See \code{?split_factors}.}

\item{gen}{The name of the column that contains the levels of the genotypes.}

\item{rep}{The name of the column that contains the levels of the
replications/blocks.}

\item{resp}{The response variables. For example \code{resp = c(var1, var2,
var3)}.}

\item{design}{The experimental design. Must be RCBD or CRD.}

\item{return}{What the function return? Default is 'distance', i.e., the
Mahalanobis distance. Alternatively, it is possible to return the matrix of
means \code{return = 'means'}, or the variance-covariance matrix of
residuals \code{return = 'covmat'}.}
}
\value{
A symmetric matrix with the Mahalanobis' distance. If the \code{.data} is an object
of class \code{split_factors} then a list of distances will be returned.
}
\description{
Compute the Mahalanobis distance using data from an experiment conducted in
a randomized complete block design or completely randomized design.

\examples{

library(metan)
maha_group = mahala_design(data_ge,
                           gen = GEN,
                           rep = REP,
                           resp = c(GY, HM))

             split_factors(ENV, keep_factors = TRUE) \%>\%
             mahala_design(GEN, REP, c(GY, HM))

                           resp = c(GY, HM),
                           return = 'covmat')
