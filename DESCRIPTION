Description: Provides functions for performing the most used
    analyses in the evaluation of multi-environment trials. This includes
    stability analysis using widely-known parametric and nonparametric
    methods, functions for biometrical analysis such as path analysis,
    canonical correlation, partial correlation, clustering analysis, as
    well as tools for summarizing and plotting data.
