# metan <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

The metan (**m**ulti-**e**nvironment **t**rials **an**alysis) package provides useful functions for analyzing multi-environment trial data using parametric and nonparametric methods, including, but not limited to:

* Within environment analysis of variance
* Cross-validation procedures for AMMI-family and BLUP models;
* Estimation using AMMI considering different numbers of interaction principal component axes;
* AMMI-based stability indexes;
* Prediction in mixed-effect models;
* BLUP-based stability indexes;
* Variance components and genetic parameters in mixed-effect models;
* Graphics tools for generating biplots.
* Parametric and nonparametric stability statistics


# Installing

The latest development version can be download from GitHub by running
```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/metan")
```

# Brief examples
The package [`kableExtra`](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) and [`cowplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html) were used to generate the tables and arranging the graphics of this material.

The `metan` contains some datasets for examples. We will use the example `data_ge` that contains data from two variables assessed in 10 genotypes growing in in 11 environments. For more details see `?data_ge`

```{r}
library(metan)
str(data_ge)
```


## AMMI model
### Fitting the model
The AMMI model is fitted with the function `waas()`. For more details, please see `?waas`.

```{r}
model <- waas(data_ge,
              resp = GY,
              gen = GEN,
              env = ENV,
              rep = REP,
              verbose = FALSE)
```


### Predicting the response variable
The S3 method `predict()` is implemented for objects of class `waas` and may be used to estimate the response of each genotype in each environment considering different number of Interaction Principal Component Axis (IPCA). For example, we will use four IPCA (number of significant IPCAs) to estimate the variable GY using the `model` object.

```{r }
library(kableExtra)
predicted = predict(model, naxis = 4)
predicted = predicted$GY[1:5,]
kable(predicted, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", "condensed", full_width = F)
```


### Biplots

ggplot2-based graphics are easily obtained in metan package. For example, the well-known AMMI2 biplot may be obtained as follows. Please, note that since `waas()` function allows analyzing multiple variables at the same time, e.g., resp = c(v1, v2, ...), the output `model` is a list, in this case with one element, GY.

```{r, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(cowplot)
p1 = plot_scores(model$GY, axis.expand = 1.5)
p2 = plot_scores(model$GY,
                 type = 1,
                 polygon = TRUE,
                 col.gen = "black",
                 col.env = "gray70",
                 col.segm.env = "gray70",
                 axis.expand = 1.5)
plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c("p1","p2"))
```

## BLUP model
The implementation of linear-mixed effect models to predict the response variable in MET is based on the `waasb()` function. The "mixed-effect version" of the already fitted AMMI model, where genotype and genotype-vs-environment interaction are assumed to be random effects is then obtained as follows

```{r }
model2 <- waasb(data_ge,
                resp = GY,
                gen = GEN,
                env = ENV,
                rep = REP,
                verbose = FALSE)
```


### Plotting the BLUPs for genotypes


```{r, fig.width=8}
p1 = plot_blup(model2$GY)
p2 = plot_blup(model2$GY,
               prob = 0.1,
               col.shape  =  c("gray20", "gray80")) + coord_flip()
plot_grid(p1, p2,
          labels = c("p1", "p2"))
```


### BLUPS for genotype-vs-environment interaction

```{r }
data = model2$GY$BLUPgge[1:5,]
kable(data, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", "condensed",
                position = "left", full_width = F, font_size = 12)
```

# Extending the metan package

The complete functionality of the metan package, combining theory, programming, and examples with outputs is described at <https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/index.html>. Suggestions and criticisms to improve the quality and usability of the package are welcome!
