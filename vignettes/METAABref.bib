abstract = {Thirteen winter and intermediate type bread wheat cultivars were evaluated for yield stability under dryland conditions over a four year period from 1991 to 1994 and over a total of 120 environments in the Western, Central and Eastern Free State wheat producing regions of South Africa. The following statistical analyses were conducted and procedures followed to determine yield stability: (i) Shukla's procedure of stability variance(*2j); (ii) Lin and Binns cultivar performance measure (Pi); (iii) Finlay and Wilkenson's regression analysis and coefficient (b); (iv) Eberhart and Russel's deviation from regression (S2d); (v) Wricke's ecovalence (W1); (vi) AMMI model. Since the AMMI model does not make provision for a quantitative stability measure, such a measure was developed to rank genotypes. Total correspondence for significance of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for the different analysis procedures was noted over the three production regions. No significant rank correlation coefficients were f...},

@article{Zali2012,
abstract = {This research was carried out to study stability analysis and comparison between some measures of stability from AMMI model in 17 chickpea genotypes, in RCBD with four replications in five different research stations of Iran across two years (2004-2005). Spearman's rank correlation was used to measure the relationship between measures of stability from AMMI model. To understand better relationships among these methods, principal component analysis, was performed. The first two PCs explained 87.65{\%} of the variance of original variables. The relationships among the different stability statistics from AMMI model are graphically displayed in a biplot of PC1 and PC2. The results also revealed that stability measures can be classified into three groups. The first group included, SIPC4, EV4, MASV, Dz4, AV (AMGE), Wi(AMMI) and FAi which were correlated with mean yield. The second group consists of ASV, Da4, Bi and Za4 which were correlated with mean yield too. Group 3 consist of FPi that was not associated with the more stability methods and mean yield. This measure may not be as good as the other methods. The results of the correlation matrix and the PC analysis between different measures of stability from AMMI model showed that all measures (except for FPi) can be used for evaluating the responses of chickpea genotypes to changing environments. Eventually, according to all measures of stability from AMMI model (except for FPi) and regarding the high mean yield, genotype G13 (FLIP 97-114) was recommended for national release in Iran, as it adequately demonstrated wide adaptation across environments.},

abstract = {In order to determine stable bread wheat genotypes with high grain yield via a single parameter, field experiments were conducted with 20 genotypes for 4 consecutive years in two different conditions (irrigated and rainfed) in a completely randomized block design with three replications in each environment. Combined analysis of variance showed highly significant differences for the GE interaction indicating the possibility of selection for stable entries. The results of additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis revealed 10{\%} of total variability was justified by the GE interaction which was 2.5 times more than that of genotypes. Ordination techniques displayed high differences for the interaction principal components (IPC1, IPC2 and IPC3), exhibiting that 83{\%} of the GE sum of squares was justified by AMMI1, AMMI2 and AMMI3, i.e., 3.77 times more than that explained by the linear regression model displaying the relative efficiency of AMMI1 model in comparison with regression model. AMMI stability value (ASV) discriminated genotypes G6, G9, G14, G15, G17 and G18 as the stable entries. As stability per se is not a desirable selection criterion, because the most stable genotypes would not necessarily give the best yield performance, hence, simultaneous consideration of grain yield and ASV in a single non-parametric index entitled: Genotype Selection Index (GSI), discriminated G6 and G17 with general adaptability and high grain yield for rainfed and irrigated conditions which was in agreement with the results of biplot analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract This study proposes a new multitrait index based on factor analysis and ideotype-design (FAI-BLUP index), and validates its potential on the selection of elephant grass genotypes for energy cogeneration. Factor analysis was carried out, and afterwards, factorial scores of each ideotype were designed according to the desirable and undesirable factors, and the spatial probability was estimated based on genotype-ideotype distance, enabling genotype ranking. In order to quantify the potential of the FAI-BLUP index, genetic gains were predicted and compared with the Smith-Hazel classical index. The FAI-BLUP index allows ranking the genotypes based on multitrait, free from multicollinearity, and it does not require assigning weights, as in the case of the Smith-Hazel classical index and its derived indices. Furthermore, the genetic correlation - positive or negative - within each factor was taken into account, preserving their traits relationship, and giving biological meaning to the ideotypes. The FAI-BLUP index indicated the 15 elephant grass with the highest performance for conversion to bioenergy via combustion, and predicted balanced and desirable genetic gains for all traits. In addition, the FAI-BLUP index predicted gains of approximately 62\% of direct selection, simultaneously for all traits that are desired to be increased, and approximately 33\% for traits which are desired to be decreased. The genotypes selected by the FAI-BLUP index have potential to improve all traits simultaneously, while the Smith-Hazel classical index predicted gains of 66\% for traits that are desired to be increased, and −32\% for traits that are desired to be decreased, and it does not have potential to improve all traits simultaneously. The FAI-BLUP index provides an undoubtable selection process and can be used in any breeding programme aiming at selection based on multitrait.},,
