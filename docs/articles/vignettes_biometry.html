<a href="#linear-and-partial-correlation-coefficients" class="anchor"></a>Linear and partial correlation coefficients</h2>
<p>Pearson’s linear correlation does not consider the influence a set of traits on the relationship between two traits. For example, the hypothetical correlation of <em>r</em> = 0.9 between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> may be due to the influence of a third trait or group of traits acting together. To identify this linear effect between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> controlling statistically the effect of others traits, the partial correlation is used. From Pearson’s simple correlation matrix, the partial correlation is calculated by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    {r_{xy.m}} = \frac{{ - {a_{xy}}}}{{\sqrt {{a_{xx}}{a_{yy}}} }}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\({r_{xy.m}}\)</span> is the partial correlation coefficient between the traits * x * and * y <em>, excluding the effects of the </em> m * remaining traits of the set; <span class="math inline">\(- {a_{ij}}\)</span> is the inverse element of the correlation matrix corresponding to xy, <span class="math inline">\({a_{ii}}{a_{jj}}\)</span> are the diagonal elements of the inverse matrix of correlation associated with trait x and y , respectively. The significance of this correlation is also tested by the test * t * according to the following expression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
t_{calc} = r_{xy.m} \sqrt \frac{n-v}{1-r_{xy.m}^2} 
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(t_{calc}\)</span> is the calculated Student * t * statistic; $ r_{xy.m} $ is the partial correlation coefficient for the traits x and y excluding the effect of the other * m * traits; * n * is the number of observations; and * v * is the number of traits. Both the linear and partial correlation coefficients may be obtained using the function <code><a href="../reference/lpcor.html">lpcor()</a></code>.</p>

<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/covcor_design.html">covcor_design()</a></code> may be used to compute genetic, phenotypic and residual correlation/(co)variance matrices through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method using randomized complete block design (RCBD) or completely randomized design (CRD).</p>
<p>The phenotypic (<span class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span>), genotypic (<span class="math inline">\(r_g\)</span>) and residual (<span class="math inline">\(r_r\)</span>) correlations are computed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r^p_{xy} = \frac{cov^p_{xy}}{\sqrt{var^p_{x}var^p_{y}}} \\
r^g_{xy} = \frac{cov^g_{xy}}{\sqrt{var^g_{x}var^g_{y}}} \\
r^r_{xy} = \frac{cov^r_{xy}}{\sqrt{var^r_{x}var^r_{y}}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using Mean Squares (<em>MS</em>) from the ANOVA method, the variances (<em>var</em>) and covariances (<em>cov</em>) are computed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
cov^p_{xy} = [(MST_{x+y} - MST_x - MST_y)/2]/r \\
var^p_x = MST_x / r \\
var^p_y = MST_y / r \\
cov^r_{xy} = (MSR_{x+y} - MSR_x - MSR_y)/2 \\
var^r_x = MSR_x \\
var^r_y = MSR_y \\
cov^g_{xy} = [(cov^p_{xy} \times r) - cov^r_{xy}]/r \\
var^g_x = (MST_x - MSE_x)/r \\
var^g_y = (MST_x - MSE_y)/r \\
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>MST</em> is the mean square for treatment, <em>MSR</em> is the mean square for residuals, and <em>r</em> is the number of replications.</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/covcor_design.html">covcor_design()</a></code> returns a list with the matrices of (co)variances and correlations. Specific matrices may be returned using the argument <code>type</code>, as shown bellow.</p>

<a href="#nonparametric-confidence-interval-for-pearsons-correlation" class="anchor"></a>Nonparametric confidence interval for Pearson’s correlation</h2>
<p>Recently, a Gaussian-independent estimator for the confidence interval of Pearson’s correlation coefficient was proposed by <span class="citation">Olivoto et al. (<a href="#ref-Olivoto2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. This estimator is based on the sample size and strength of associations and may be estimated using the function <code><a href="../reference/corr_ci.html">corr_ci()</a></code>. It is possible to estimate the confidence interval by declaring the sample size (n) and the correlation coefficient (r), or using a dataframe. The following code computes the confidence interval and make a plot to show the results.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><html><body><pre class="r">
# Use a data frame
corr_ci(data_ge2, contains("E"), verbose = FALSE) %&gt;%
plot_ci()</pre></body></html></div>
<p><img src="vignettes_biometry_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>In the following examples, the confidence interval is calculated by declaring the sample size (n) and the correlation coefficient (r). Using the argument <code>by = ENV</code> the confidence interval can be calculated within each level of the factor <code>ENV</code>.</p>

The number of clusters may also be found using intensive computation. I suggest the package <a href="http://stat.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/prog/pvclust/">pcvlust</a>, an R package for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis.

<a href="#indicating-the-variables-to-compute-the-distances" class="anchor"></a>Indicating the variables to compute the distances</h3>
<p>It is possible to indicate the variables from the data_ge2 to compute the distances. To do that is easy. You should only provide a comma-separated list of unquoted variable names after the .data argument. For example, to compute the distances between the genotypes based on the variables NKR, TKW, and NKE, the following arguments should be used.</p>

<p>The distances were computed using the variables ED, CW, KW, NKR, TKW, and NKE. By using these variables the highest cophenetic correlation coefficient (0.8658) was observed. The Mantel’s correlation estimated with the distance matrix of Model 10 (selected variables) with the original distance matrix (estimated with all variables) was near to 1, suggesting that the deletion of the variables to compute the distance don’t affect significantly the computation of the distances.</p>
