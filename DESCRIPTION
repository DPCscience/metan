Description: Provides functions for performing the most
             used analyses in the evaluation of multi-environment trials.
             This includes stability analysis using widely-known parametric
             and nonparametric methods, functions for biometrical analysis such
             as path analysis, canonical correlation, partial correlation,
             clustering analysis, as well as tools for summarizing and plotting data.
